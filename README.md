Option b: Build a MRP model based on the CES and a post- stratification dataset that you obtain, to identify how the 2019 Canadian Federal Election would have been different if ‘everyone’ had voted. What do we learn about the importance of turnout based on your model and results?

# Predicting the Percentage of Votes Obtained by Liberal in 2019 Canadian Federal Election If Everyone Can Vote Using Logistic Regression With Post-stratification

# Abstract
Liberal won the 2019 Canadian Federal Election, but Liberal receives fewer votes compared to Conservative. Some people may wonder, if everyone in Canada has the right to vote, would the Liberal Party still have a lower vote rate than the Conservative? In this report, a logistic regression model with post-stratification is built and aim to estimate Liberal’s percentage vote obtained if everyone in Canada has the right to vote. After doing the statistical analysis, we found that if everyone can vote in Canada, liberals would still receive less vote than conservatives.
